# Feature Documentation Updates

When you have implemented a new feature or materially changed an existing feature (examples: new page, new service method, new shared component, changed page behavior, new model), **ask the user**:

> "Would you like me to update the feature documentation in `docs/FEATURES.md`?"

If the user says yes:
1. Open `docs/FEATURES.md`
2. Add or update the relevant section to reflect the change
3. Keep the same style and level of detail as existing entries
4. Include: what the feature does, which files are involved, and any notable behavior

Do NOT update the doc silently -- always ask first.
